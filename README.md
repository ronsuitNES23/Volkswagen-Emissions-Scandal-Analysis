Using Google Causal Impact to look at Volkswagen Share Price Index in the wake of the CO2 Emissions Scandal

Average Response During Post-Intervention Period: The report starts by stating that during the period following the CO2 emissions scandal, the average value of Volkswagen's share price was approximately $87.73.

Counterfactual Prediction: It compares this observed average with what would have been expected in the absence of the scandal, which is estimated to be $113.36. This estimation comes with a 95% interval of $[102.98, 122.89].

Causal Effect Estimate: The causal effect of the CO2 emissions scandal on Volkswagen's share price is estimated at -$25.63. This means that, on average, the scandal led to a decrease in the share price. The 95% interval for this effect is $[-35.16, -15.25], suggesting a fairly high level of confidence in this estimate.

Relative Change: In relative terms, the share price decreased by approximately -22.61% due to the scandal. The 95% interval for this percentage change is [-31.02%, -13.46%]. This provides another perspective on the magnitude of the impact.

Statistical Significance: The report emphasizes that the observed negative effect of the intervention (CO2 emissions scandal) is statistically significant. This is further supported by a Bayesian one-sided tail-area probability (p-value) of 0.0, indicating a very low likelihood of obtaining such an effect by chance.

In summary, the analysis indicates that the CO2 emissions scandal had a statistically significant negative impact on Volkswagen's share price during the specified period. The share price decreased by a substantial amount, and this effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance. This information could be important for investors, policymakers, or anyone interested in understanding the financial consequences of the scandal for Volkswagen.
